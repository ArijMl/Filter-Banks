This article delves into the process of analyzing and synthesizing audio signals using filter banks, exploring its key steps and implementations. By decomposing the signal into various frequency components, filter banks provide valuable insights and enable manipulation for diverse applications.

1. Loading the Prototype Filter:

The journey begins with loading a prototype filter from a text file named "prototypeFilter2.txt". This filter serves as the foundation for constructing the filter banks used later. Transposing the filter ensures it's in the appropriate format for subsequent operations.

2. Visualizing the Prototype Filter:

To gain a deeper understanding of the prototype filter, a two-subplot plot is created. The first subplot visualizes the filter's impulse response, revealing its behavior in response to a brief input. The second subplot, showcasing the frequency response, provides information about how the filter treats different frequency components.

3. Creating Filter Banks:

We leverage the prototype filter to construct two essential filter banks:

Analysis Filter Bank: Responsible for dissecting an audio signal into multiple frequency bands. Think of it as breaking down the signal's complex composition into simpler, individual frequency components.
Synthesis Filter Bank: In contrast, this bank takes the decomposed frequency bands and reconstructs a new signal by stitching them back together.
4. Generating an Input Signal:

As a test subject, a sinusoidal input signal with a relatively low frequency is generated. To scrutinize this signal, a two-subplot plot is once again employed. The first subplot displays the signal in the time domain, allowing us to see its waveform over time. The second subplot shifts our perspective to the frequency domain, showcasing the distribution of energy across different frequencies.

5. Signal Analysis and Synthesis:

Now comes the magic:

Analysis: We apply the analysis filter bank to the input signal. This dissects the signal into its constituent frequency bands, capturing the energy present at each frequency.
Synthesis: Taking the extracted frequency bands, we utilize the synthesis filter bank to reconstruct a new signal. This essentially reverses the analysis process, aiming to recreate the original signal as closely as possible.
To evaluate the outcome, another two-subplot plot comes into play:

The first subplot showcases the reconstructed, synthesized signal in the time domain, allowing us to compare it to the original input.
The second subplot returns to the frequency domain, revealing the spectral representation of the synthesized signal. By scrutinizing it, we can assess the fidelity of the reconstruction process.
Conclusion:

This exploration journey has demonstrated the power of filter banks in analyzing and synthesizing audio signals. By decomposing the signal into frequency components, valuable insights and manipulations become feasible. This versatile technique finds applications in a wide range of areas, including audio compression, speech synthesis, and signal processing, making it a key tool in the audio engineer's arsenal.
